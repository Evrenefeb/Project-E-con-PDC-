# Welcome to "My Educational Software" Project E-con

This is my first project released on GitHub.
This project is only and only created for educational purposes by me. 
I'm currently 2nd year Software / Computer Engineer (2024). 
I want to solve them by myself for better understanding.

Project original purpose is to create a web application for audio connection using host and client system.

Hosts are act like server and client at the same time.
Clients can connect to host's servers with related information.

This project includes:
- Client Application
- Local Server

And,

This project uses:
- NAudio (https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/tree/master)
- WebSocketSharp (https://github.com/PingmanTools/websocket-sharp)

Open source libraries.

As a reminder I will work on this project for educational purposes if I can.
